Ask the user to enter a positive number. Determine whether the number is a Germain Prime number or not.  A number, say n, is said to be a Germain Prime number if it is prime and 2*n + 1 is prime as well. 5 is a Germain Prime since it is prime and 2*5 + 1 = 11 is prime as well. 11 is also a Germain prime since it is prime and 2*11 + 1 = 23 is prime as well. 13 is not a Germain Prime, although it is prime but 2*13 + 1 = 27 is not prime.  6 is not a Germain prime, although 2*6 + 1 = 13 is prime but 6 is not.
Ask the user to enter a positive number. Determine whether the number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect when the sum of its factors, except itself, is equal to itself. For instance, 6 is perfect, since the sum of its factors, 1, 2 and 3 (except 6 itself) is 6. 28 is perfect since the sum if its factors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (except 28 itself) is 28. 10 is not perfect since the sum of its factors 1, 2, 5 (except 10 itself) is 8 and not 10.
