MP 5 (Problem Solving on Series)
Observe the following series: 6  12  14   28  30  60 ... Create a flowchart that would ask the user to enter a positive number, say n.  The flowchart must be able to display the nth element of the series. For instance, if n = 3, the chart should display 14.  If n = 6, the chart should display 60. Since this is an infinite series, your solution should be able to handle inputs that are greater than 6.
Observe the following sequence: 1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55 ... Create a flowchart that would ask the user to enter a positive number, say n. The flowchart must be able to display the first n elements of the sequence. For instance, if n = 3, the chart should display the first 3 elements of the sequence which are 1  1  2.  If n = 6, it should display 1  1  2  3  5  8.  Since this is an infinite sequence, your solution should be able to handle inputs that are greater than 6.
